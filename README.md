# Sharplin
Kotlin stdlib for C#.

Are you tired of writing some basic logic yourself? Do you want to get lazy? Are you jealous of your Kotlin friends having a rich stdlib with shortcuts for everything your heart desires? Well, then this library is for you!

Sharplin provides simple yet useful extensions over C# stdlib to make your life easier as a developer. No longer you have to write the code to find the first element in an array that matches the given predicate yourself! How cool is that?

Also the name is epic, isn't it?
