[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Xinto.Sharplin.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xinto.Sharplin/)  
Sharplin is a .NET library that ports sweet tools and extensions from Kotlin to C#.

Introduction
-----------
Are you tired of writing some basic logic yourself? Do you want to get lazy? Are you jealous of your Kotlin friends
having a rich stdlib with shortcuts for everything your heart desires? Well, then this library is for you!

Sharplin provides simple yet useful extensions for C# to make your life easier as a developer. No longer you have to
write the code to find the first element in an array that matches the given predicate yourself! How cool is that?
